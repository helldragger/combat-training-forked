Adds training dummies and a train combat job to train your colonists.

Getting started:
1. Build a dummy
2. Click the dummy
3. Toggle the kind of training you want to allow on it (can be both)
4. Set your colonist to train combat in its work priorities
5. (optionally) craft training weapons to avoid damaging and needing to repair your dummies too often.

What about the forked version? It's Combat Training but with most problems fixed:
1. No more breaking dummies during training, colonist now stop using a dummy if it lacks more than 50% of its HP! You can still one shot them though, be careful with your nukes. >:(
2. No more repairing dummies using a Component (thanks to Velcroboy33), they never needed any anyway.
3. No more forgetting weapons most of the time! Colonists now store their weapon in their inventory when using training weapons, and whip it out when they stop training!
4. No more training loop when the max level is reached.
5. Turned public most private things, if you want to patch something, now you CAN.

All credit is due to Krill, the original author for the original idea and implementation, and the contributors who helped him up to the version 1.1.
This is a full replacement and is NOT compatible with the original mod.
